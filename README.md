# Lord Jack Carvell  
@LordCarvell

I mess with computers until they either work or cry.

Linux.  
Python.  
Security.  
Whatever else looks interesting this week.

## What this GitHub is

Not a portfolio.  
Not a flex page.

It’s just where my stuff lives.

Scripts I wrote because I was bored.  
Labs I did because I was curious.  
Things I broke and had to un-break.  
Half finished ideas that turned into something useful.

If it’s here, it taught me something.

## What I’m doing right now

- Running Kali on my main machine  
- Learning Linux properly instead of pretending  
- Writing Python to automate dumb things  
- Doing TryHackMe and similar labs  
- Figuring out how systems actually get owned

---

## Why

Because clicking buttons is boring.

I want to know:
- what’s running
- why it’s running
- what happens when it breaks
- and how someone would abuse it

That’s the fun part.

## What you’ll see here over time

- Python tools  
- Linux scripts  
- Security notes  
- Weird experiments  
- Stuff that didn’t work the first time  

Probably some chaos too.

That’s it.  
Everything else is in the commits.
